Let $G, G'\gets\mathbb{J}$ be two generators for the subgroup $\mathbb{J}$ of order $t$ of the Jubjub elliptic curve. 
In Citadel, each party involved in the protocol holds a pair of static keys with the following structure:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Secret key:} $\sk = (a,b)$, where $a,b\gets \F_t$.
	\item \textit{Public key:} $\pk = (A,B)$, where $A = a G$ and $B = b G$.
\end{itemize}

We use the subindices $\user, \SP, \LP$ to indicate the owner of the keys, e.g. $\pk_\user$ denotes the public key of the user.
