In this section, we present the static keys associated each party involved in the protocol, and also the structure of the elements involved.

\mbi{I suggest to include a section with the details of the cryptographic elements included in this section (the jubjub group, the generators, etc.).}

\mbi{Add a section including the software that it is assumed each participant uses? For example, user makes use of wallet and does blockchain calls and queries. The blockchain stores a license contract that can be called blabla. The LP and SP software, etc. (see previous section 4.1 from Milosz).}
