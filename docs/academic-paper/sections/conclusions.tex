In this paper, we have introduced two main contributions. We have described a private-by-design NFT model for the Dusk Network Blockchain. This allows issuing of unique assets in the network, that remain private to anyone but the receiver. We also showed how this approach perfectly integrates into the current transaction model of Dusk. 

Then, we introduced \verb!Citadel!, which uses the NFT model to issue licenses to users, whose ownership can be privately demonstrated afterward. Among all the features described in the protocol details, we demonstrated how the main problems in previous solutions are solved: licenses cannot be traced on-chain, and their usage can be nullified in a decentralized manner by means of the Blockchain itself. As such, our solution serves the privacy concerns of the users, while the SPs have the guarantee that the licenses they issue will not be misused (e.g. used more times than what is permitted). After detailing the security behind our protocol, we provided a proof-of-concept implementation of the proving system, along with some benchmarks and deployment specifications that prove its feasibility in a real scenario.

Beyond all the use cases and examples described in this work, our solution can also be seen as a framework to be adapted and modified according to the needs that specific applications can have. Working in more specific applications and being able to deploy \verb!Citadel! in real scenarios would be interesting future work.
