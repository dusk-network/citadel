abstract = {The existence of succinct non-interactive arguments for NP (i.e., non-interactive
computationally-sound proofs where the verifier's work is essentially independent
of the complexity of the NP nondeterministic verifier) has been an intriguing question
for the past two decades. Other than CS proofs in the random oracle model [Micali,
FOCS '94], the only existing candidate construction is based on an elaborate assumption
that is tailored to a specific protocol [Di Crescenzo and Lipmaa, CiE '08].We formulate
a general and relatively natural notion of an extractable collision-resistant hash
function (ECRH) and show that, if ECRHs exist, then a modified version of Di Crescenzo
and Lipmaa's protocol is a succinct non-interactive argument for NP. Furthermore,
the modified protocol is actually a succinct non-interactive adaptive argument of
knowledge (SNARK). We then propose several candidate constructions for ECRHs and relaxations
thereof.We demonstrate the applicability of SNARKs to various forms of delegation
of computation, to succinct non-interactive zero knowledge arguments, and to succinct
two-party secure computation. Finally, we show that SNARKs essentially imply the existence
of ECRHs, thus demonstrating the necessity of the assumption.},
